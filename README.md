# Problem Statement

Ever moved into a new locality or a new city? 
Moving into a new city or neighborhood is a tough task and finding the basic amenities at an affordable price is always a concern.

Finding and renting home, party plots, etc in various localities is very difficult, getting an overall perspective of the neighborhood and its surroundings is a major requirement for all.
Let it be the household workers or maids you are hiring, there’s always a fear of them having a criminal record or you being a victim of theft or harassment. Finding a trusted maid is an headache for the public.
Going from one place to another, but don’t have a vehicle? 
Transportation is another major concern in today’s fast life. Let it be students or working population, they all need it.
